# KNN-Image-Classification

I am using KNN Classifier to classify images divided into 2 classes. Training Dataset have 20 images with first 10 of Octopus and rest of Shark. Testing Dataset have 10 images with first 5 of Octopus and rest of Shark. I have run it for both Manhattan Distance and Euclidean Distance for values of k from 1 to 7. For Manhattan, at K=1 accuracy came out to be highest i.e. 80% and for Euclidean, at K=1 and K=3, accuracy is highest i.e., 70%
